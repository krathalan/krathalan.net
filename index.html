<br>I am passionate about free software, and I work on a number of free software projects.
<br>My main project is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~krathalan/wtwitch">wtwitch</a>, a cli tool for browsing and watching streams on Twitch.tv.</p>

<p>All of the software I make is available at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~krathalan">sourcehut</a>.
<br>Sometimes I make pull requests to other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/krathalan">Github</a>.</p>
