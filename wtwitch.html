<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>wtwitch <strong>[COMMAND]</strong> <em>[args]</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Wtwitch is a terminal program that uses the Twitch API and the
streamlink package to provide Twitch browsing, subscription, and
playback functionality without signing up for a Twitch account and
without loading or executing Twitch's proprietary JavaScript.</p>

<h1>TAB COMPLETION</h1>
<p>Wtwitch will try its best to complete your input. When tabbing after
wtwitch <strong>u</strong>, wtwitch will list/fill in your current
subscriptions, since it only makes sense to unsubscribe from someone
you're subscribed to.</p>
<p>When tabbing after wtwitch <strong>w</strong>, wtwitch will get a
list of your subscriptions that are online, and only list/fill in your
subscribed streamers that are currently streaming (even though these are
not the only streamers you can watch with <strong>w</strong>).</p>
<h1>DEFAULT BEHAVIOR</h1>
<h2>Player</h2>
<p>Wtwitch will tell Streamlink to use mpv by default. Wtwitch favors
mpv because mpv supports Wayland and custom window titles, such as
"Watching dratnos on Twitch". Wtwitch will use VLC automatically if you
have VLC installed and don't have mpv installed.</p>
<p>You can set which video player you'd like wtwitch to pass to
Streamlink with wtwitch <strong>p</strong> <em>player</em>. You can pass
any player you'd pass to Streamlink, and wtwitch will make sure the
player you're trying to set as the default player is in your $PATH.</p>
<h2>Quality</h2>
<p>Wtwitch tells Streamlink to choose the "best" quality by default. You
can set which quality you'd like wtwitch to pass to Streamlink with
wtwitch <strong>q</strong> <em>quality</em>. You can pass any quality
you'd pass to Streamlink, including fallback qualities (like
"720p,480p,worst"), and wtwitch will make sure your input is valid.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Wtwitch tells Streamlink to bypass Twitch ads. If you want to support
a streamer, consider donating to them directly rather than subscribing
to them on Twitch, as Twitch takes a substantial portion (30-50%) of the
subscription fee.</p>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<p>Wtwitch supports the XDG Base Directory specification. If your
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CACHE_HOME are their default values (~/.config
and ~/.cache respectively), the configuration and blocklist files are at
~/.config/wtwitch/config.json, and cache files are kept in
~/.cache/wtwitch.</p>
<p>You should never need to edit these files manually; you should use
the commands listed under <strong>COMMANDS</strong> above.</p>
<h2>environment.sh</h2>
<p>This file exists in wtwitch's config directory, and wtwitch will
source this file before running. You can put commands or variables here
for wtwitch to source. This is useful on macOS, for example, to set a
custom $PATH or $PYTHONPATH to support non-standard dependency locations
specifically for wtwitch.</p>
<h1>SYNCING SUBSCRIPTIONS</h1>
<p>Wtwitch does not natively support syncing subscriptions across
computers, but syncing subscriptions can be achieved easily using
Syncthing and a utility already installed on your GNU/Linux computer.
Syncthing is a powerful synchronization program for multiple operating
systems licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2, which is FSF
approved. You can look at Syncthing's homepage for more information, as
well as their user documentation:</p>
<p>https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html</p>
<p>After setting up Syncthing on the computers on which you wish to sync
subscriptions, copy your subscriptions file from
~/.config/wtwitch/config.json to a directory that you are syncing with
Syncthing. Then link the file to the previous location. For example, if
you copied your subscriptions file to ~/Documents/Config, you can link
it to the correct location with the command:</p>
<p>ln -sf ~/Documents/Config/config.json
~/.config/wtwitch/config.json</p>

<p><strong>If you are reporting a bug, please attach a debug
log.</strong></p>
<p>To start wtwitch in debug mode, set the environment variable
WTWITCH_DEBUG=on. You should also redirect all output to a <em>log
file</em>. You can run wtwitch in debug mode in a one-off command like
